# List of Things That Need to be Done Before the Project is Finished

- All sound loading (MP3s cannot load, some types of WAV file don't work for some reason)
- Finally implement a garbage collector
- Go to, glide to, and point towards menu handling for other sprites
- Say / Think blocks
- All graphics effects except Ghost
- An actual layering system
- Pitch / Pan sound effects
- Event blocks
	- When this sprite clicked
	- When backdrop switches to
	- When loudness >
- The entire messaging system
- The entire clone system
- Collision system
	- Touching mouse / sprite / edge
	- Touching colour
	- Colour is touching colour
- Ask / answer system
- A lot of keys for the key pressed block
- Set drag mode
- Loudness reporter
- Backdrop # of stage reporter
- current <> reporter
- days since 2000
- username
- Addons?
- Better error handling / error messages
- Track down that one discrepancy between math blocks (I wish I had more details, I don't.)
- Optimise pen
- Optimise the `fix.bat` step, potentially include it in `scratchcompiler`?
